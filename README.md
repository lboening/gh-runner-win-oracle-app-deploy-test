## üîß Configuration

See the `configs/` directory for example configurations:

- IIS website and application pool settings
- Oracle database connection strings
- Application deployment parameters

## üí∞ Cost Optimization

This project includes automated cleanup scripts that run daily at 23:00 to delete the entire Azure resource group, helping to minimize costs when the environment is not in use.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: The cleanup scripts will permanently delete all resources in the specified resource group!

### Quick Setup for Daily Cleanup

```powershell
# Configure your Azure details (run as Administrator)
cd scripts\cleanup
.\Setup-ScheduledCleanup.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "your-rg-name" -SubscriptionId "your-subscription-id"

# Test first with dry run
.\Remove-AzureResourceGroup.ps1 -ResourceGroupName "your-rg-name" -SubscriptionId "your-subscription-id" -DryRun

# Check scheduled task status
.\Manage-CleanupTask.ps1 -Action Status
```

For detailed cleanup documentation, see [`scripts/cleanup/README.md`](scripts/cleanup/README.md).

## üß™ Testing

Run the validation scripts to ensure proper setup:

```powershell
.\scripts\validation\Test-Environment.ps1
.\scripts\validation\Test-Applications.ps1
```
